# Html Css
 ## we will talk about tow themes in **Css**
 ## introdocing
**CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look**
 so the Rules are made up of selectors that specify the elements the rule applies to and declarations that indicate what these elements should look like .
 *so there are different  types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may 
 appear within an HTML page*
## the color
 **Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions Color pickers can help you find the color you want.**
 **There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:** 
* RGB values
* hex codes 
* color names
*CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA,CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value
It is known as HSLA*
*finally we should contrast between any text and the background color*
