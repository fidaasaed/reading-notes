# introduction who the computer work 

**firstly look at information in side the computer then the instruction and the different part of the computer input and  output  in the store in that information computer is every ware 4 things is common of all computer** 

* storage

* in put

* output

* processing

** the computer processing is take the data from memory so it continue the processing  the information and then out put them same computer in machines do those processes**

*the computers work in ones and zeros that  do play  bog role that who computers work the wires and circuits carry the information in cp   the one wire care the pit the computer has binary system 1 0  so if the signal 0 the circuits gives you 1

if the signal1 and 1 the circuits is one but the a lot of signal it will be a complex  circuits 

*input devices take the signals  from all devices and the memory and there is cpu  that all conclusions will done and finally output the information to devices* 

**the cpu send receive and out the information to and come the information**
